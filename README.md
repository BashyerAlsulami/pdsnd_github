### Project Title
bikeShare1.py

### Description
In this project, I used Python to analyze data from bike-sharing systems in three major cities in the U.S.â€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote code to load the data and calculate key statistics about bike usage. Additionally, I created a Python script that allows users to interact with the program by entering input (such as city, month, or day) to view specific statistics in the terminal
